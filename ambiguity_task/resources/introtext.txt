You will see a short text of either one or two sentences, in which one word is highlighted in color. The highlighted word typically can take on two (or more) different meanings, depending on the context. Your task is to annotate which of the two displayed meanings of the word is likely to be the correct one. 

If one of the meanings is clearly likelier than the other, only pick that one.
If both meanings seem plausible, pick both. Even if one word sense is generally likelier than the other, both should be picked if the sense could plausibly be meant.

If there is another meaning that seems more plausible, pick neither and comment the sense in the free text field.
Additionally, feel free to mark sentences as nonsensical if there is no way for them to make sense with any meaning. Even for the nonsensical sentences, try to annotate the senses to the best of your ability.
Also, feel free to add comments in the comment field.

Examples:

"Amid the gala, her misplaced [spectacle] drew everyone's attention. Despite her embarrassment, she fumbled with her eyewear, desperately trying to fix them."

( ) a blunder that makes you look ridiculous
(x) optical instrument consisting of a frame that holds a pair of lenses for correcting defective vision

Better meaning: [""]
Nonsensical: []

Explanation: It is not completely obvious from the first sentence, but the second sentence makes it clear that the spectacle is referring to an accessory.

"The judge had a stutter, making it hard to understand each [sentence]."

(x) a string of words satisfying the grammatical rules of a language
( ) final judgment of guilty in a criminal case and the punishment that is imposed

Better meaning: [""]
Nonsensical: []


Explanation: While it could theoretically refer to the judgment-sense, especially given the judge-actor, the notion of "EACH sentence" makes the grammatical sense more plausible. This is because there is only one judgment per trial, while there can be many strings of words.

"The team gathered to discuss the adjustment of electrical properties within the division. The committee elected to [charge] the technician with ensuring the system's optimal performance."

(x) assign a duty, responsibility or obligation to
( ) cause formation of a net electrical charge in or on

Better meaning: [""]
Nonsensical: []

Explanation: The text reads like a pun considering the electricity-themed word choice. However, it is clear that the technician was assigned the duty, not charged with electricity. Even when the text seems to be aware of a word's multiple senses, take it literally and think about what is really happening.

"No, these shoes fit perfectly."

(x) "be the right size or shape; fit correctly or as desired"
(x) "go together"

Better meaning: [""]
Nonsensical: []

Explanation: Either meaning may apply depending on the context. If the speaker tries the shoes on for the first time and comments on its size, the first meaning fits. If the context is thinking about what would fit well with an outfit, the second meaning fits better. It is subjective if one is more likely, but they are both very plausible.

"The artist wanted to become famous. He tried to [draw] attention to his art using vibrant colours."

( ) make a mark or lines on a surface
( ) the finish of a contest in which the score is tied and the winner is undecided

Better meaning: ["to pull in a crowd"]
Nonsensical: []

Explanation: The art-context may make the "make a mark or lines on a surface" sense seem more likely at first glance, but "to draw attention" is a fixed expression that has nothing to do with art.
