## Before you start 

Each page shows a short story, one word in it, and one possible meaning of that word. For each page you will:

1. *Rate* how plausible the given meaning of the word is in this story.

2. *Explain* what shaped your rating: the story itself, what you know about the world, or both.

3. *Mark* the words that mattered most.
    

The first example is practice: If you make a mistake, we will tell you what you should have done.

The second and third examples are qualification: If you make a mistake, you will get screened out and partially compensated.
