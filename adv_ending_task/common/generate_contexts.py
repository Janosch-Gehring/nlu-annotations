        Your task: Give me a five sentence story, where the sentence is the {position} sentence in the story.
        Keep the sentences short, keep the language simple. Write in normal language and avoid fancy descriptions. The story can be mundane.
        Keep in mind that both meanings of the word should remain plausible, because we don't know the original intent of the author. 
        Please refrain from referencing the meanings through synonyms or paraphrases. Don't use the word {sample["word"]} either, but you can introduce other new information. Avoid naming unnamed characters. Regarding the meanings of the word, keep it implicit and a bit vague.
        Return the story in json format, containing the keys 'beginning' (sentences before the given sentence), 'sentence' (the given sentence), 'ending' (sentences after the given sentence). E.g.
        {{"beginning": "some sentences...", "sentence": {sample["revision"]}, "ending": "some sentences..."}}

        Please refrain from referencing the meanings through synonyms or paraphrases. Don't use the word {sample["word"]} either, but you can introduce other new information. The three texts should be fairly distinct from another. Regarding the meanings of the word, keep it implicit and a bit vague.
