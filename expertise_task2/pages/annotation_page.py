From now on, the terms will become much more obscure. You probably will not know most of them. **Please continue skipping terms that you don't know!**
                
Some tips:
                
- Each category will fit to at least one term. You may use process of elimination to connect the last term.
                
- You will not be rejected for knowing too little or making some mistakes. Please simply give this test an honest shot.
                
- **Please do not blindly guess or cheat by using search engines.**
   
- There are 21 groups of 5 terms in total.

To be 'familiar' with a term, you must have heard of it before and have an understanding of the concept, but you are not expected to know the details or definition. 
For example, if the term is 'cello', you may say you are familiar with it if you at least know that it is some type of string instrument.
                
The purpose of this study is simply to check the familiarity of English speakers with these terms. There is no point in cheating or lying, so please be honest. 
You probably won't be familiar with most of the words, and we promise you will not get rejected for 'knowing too little' or anything like that.
